Day 1:
    Intro
    Install VS Code, npm, npm install -g eslint, ...
        Extensions: Live Server, ESLint, Firefox/Chrome Debugger
    Clone class repo
    Run first demo and change a few things

Day 2: syntax, variables, values, types, operators
    Some slides then Kahoot Tower game or Quizzlet Blast

Day 3: if, loops, functions
    Some slides then pedestrian simulator

Day 4: math, strings, arrays, basic objects, destructuring, higher-order functions
    Some slides then Google Doc and finish pedestrian simulator

Day 5: objects and classes
Day 6: exceptions
Day 7: modules
Day 8: modules finish, then basic scene
Day 9: basic scene finish, then orthographic camera
Day 10: perspective camera, then debug camera, then geometry/mesh (the activity we did in class would be better in Ch 5)
Day 11: geometry/mesh finish including person hierarchy
Day 12: lights 1
Day 13: lights 2 (only about half a day... missing an activity here)  [was sick]
Day 14: materials 1 ?  [was sick]
Day 15: materials 1, start project 1
Day 16: materials 2
Day 17: materials 2 finish, project 1 check-in (should be a day later in the future)
Day 18: Geometries
Day 19: Promises (middle of 02d from S2023) & Adv Geometries 1 (activity with SVG extrude)
Day 20: Check-In & Adv Geometries 2 (Parametric Geometry, Text Geometry, Wireframe/Edges Geometry)

At some point parts of typed arrays, the async chapters, DOM and events.




Week 1-2: JS Basics
Week 3: Computer Graphics Basic (Ch 1 & 2)
Week 4: Lights 3
Week 5: Materials 4
Week 6-8: Geometries and Transformations 5, 6, 8  (skipping 7, maybe move first part of Ch 8 earlier?)
Week 9: Animation and Interaction (9)
Week 10-11: Textures, Maps, and Blending (10)
Week 12-13: Post Processing and Filters (11)
Week 14: Custom Shaders (end of 11) and Materials (part of 4)
Week 15: Audio (end of 12)

Week 15: Hierarchy and Scene Graphs?

5: Start projects
8: Project 1
12: Project 2
16: Final Project

Homeworks:
x   JS stuff
x   CAD Display: Show in isometric view, sides, multi-view, dimetric, trimetric, perspective, …
x   Lighting: Three-Point Lighting like http://www.3drender.com/light/3point.html
Skipped, started project instead    Materials: A custom material? I dunno.
    Hierarchy: person made with basic shapes and moveable joints (not using skeleton) - did this in class instead
    Something with simple collision (no physics engine, cookbook has some info about this) - bouncing balls or pickup and drop
    Textures: Load a can with a waiting screen?

Project ideas:
x Checkers (3D)
  Rubix cube (with mirrors?)
x Flight simulator (random terrain, drone body, crash animation)
